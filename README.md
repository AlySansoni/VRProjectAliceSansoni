# Augmented Reality Project: Discovering the beauties of the world

AR Project done at University of Milan for the exam "Virtual Reality". The app exploits image-based targets of 2D famous building around the world and when pointed the 3D model of the related building appears and it is possible to interact with it (rotation and zoom). It is also possible to listen to the Italian or English Description and you can also save it to favourites, to visualize them later.
